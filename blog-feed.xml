Facebook Local combines events and permanent places to a single search engine powered by Facebook’s 70 million business pages plus reviews and friends’ check-ins.</p>

<p>Facebook Local is divided into 3 sections: The homescreen shows quick searches for restaurants or drinks, and a running list of events happening nearby that you might be interested in. You can also see which events your friends have expressed interest in, in case you want to tag along. Second, there’s a map and a search engine. You can search for "coffee" or "Thai food," sort by "open now”. The last section is your calendar. </p>

<p>If you're looking for the perfect dinner spot, all you have to do is click the "Restaurants" icon, and the app will populate a list of places nearby, along with their ratings and which of your Facebook friends have checked-in there in the past. So now your choice can be based on the recommendation of a friend, rather than a stranger's review. The app also appears to be an outcome for traveling people, Facebook Local lets you change your location to find out what’s happening in another city.  </p>

Instagram Television or IGTV is a new app for watching long-form, vertical video from your favorite Instagram creators.

Influencer marketing is one of the channels that is gaining popularity. In this blog we hand you 3 tips that will help you become a real pro on influencer marketing.   </p>

<p><strong>1. Be very selective</strong></p>

<p>Regardless of the budget of your campaign, the focus of choosing the right influencers should always be on the match between brand and influencer. Quality ranks way and above quantity. Do your research properly and decide what kind of influencers are relevant to your niche. Then delve even deeper into each individual and the demographics of their audience: the highest ROI will come from an influencer who is as closely aligned to your brand as possible. Festival content is especially suitable for lifestyle and fashion influencers.</p>

<p><strong>2. Use Micro-influencers</strong> </p>

<p>Influencer marketing doesn’t have to cost thousands of euro’s or dollars. Working with a handful of micro-influencers might deliver great results. All at a fraction of the cost of only one celebrity influencer. Furthermore, micro-influencers are scattered across industries. This means that there’s an influencer for every brand or industry!  </p>

<p><strong>3. Build a relationship to benefit on the long-term</strong> </p>

<p>Influencer marketing can not only be used to hype this year’s event; influencer content can also help to build on the festival’s image. When influencers attend an event and post about its highlights, they create enthusiasm for next year’s event. Through videos, pictures and words, they are able to make an event memorable, even to those who weren’t there. In short: next to the pre- and at-engagement, make sure you don't forget the post-engagement!  </p>
<p>Starting with influencer marketing right now? We can help you choose the right influencers!</p>
